This repository is a companions to (ARXIV) (DOI). It contains the cWB analysis presented in the paper and all necessary configuration files to replicate the results. We also provide mathematica notebooks and scripts for reproducing many of the plots from the publication. 

To keep the repository size manageable, we do not provide data from the injection stydies for the p-value and energy error estimation.

This repository is complementar to https://github.com/jahedabedi/GW190521echo, where the data for the PyCBC analysis of the same work is available.


We encourage use of these data in derivative works. If you use the material provided here, please cite the paper using the reference:
